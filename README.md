## Overview

The Pac-Man projects were developed to apply an array of AI techniques to playing Pac-Man. However, these projects 
don't focus on building AI for video games. Instead, they teach foundational AI concepts, such as informed state-space search, 
probabilistic inference, and reinforcement learning. These concepts underly real-world application areas such as natural language 
processing, computer vision, and robotics.

## Projects Overview
* Project 0 - [UNIX/Python Tutorial](https://www.cs.rpi.edu/~xial/Teaching/2019SAI/projects/tutorial/tutorial.html): This short UNIX/Python tutorial introduces the Python programming language and the UNIX environment.

* Project 1 - [Search in Pacman](https://www.cs.rpi.edu/~xial/Teaching/2019SAI/projects/search/search.html): Implemented depth-first, breadth-first, uniform cost, and A* search algorithms. These algorithms are used to solve navigation and traveling salesman problems in the Pacman world.

* Project 2 - [Multi-Agent Search](https://www.cs.rpi.edu/~xial/Teaching/2019SAI/projects/tutorial/tutorial.html): Implemented multiagent Minimax, Alpha-Beta Pruning, and Expectimax algorithms, as well as designed evaluation functions.

* Project 3 - [Reinforcement Learning](https://www.cs.rpi.edu/~xial/Teaching/2019SAI/projects/reinforcement/reinforcement.html): Currently implementing model-based and model-free reinforcement learning algorithms, applied to the AIMA textbook's Gridworld, Pacman, and a simulated crawling robot.
